# NewsFlow

Welcome to **NewsFlow**, an automated news scraper and aggregator that runs entirely within GitHub workflows! Why would you need that? Well... It began as a joke and now it's a tool for gathering the latest news articles from across the web. NewsFlow automatically scrapes various reputable sources every day and stores them in the output folder which you can then query to make your own NewsAPI for free. 

## Features

- **Automated Scraping**: NewsFlow utilizes GitHub Actions to run daily scraping routines, ensuring that you receive fresh content without manual intervention.
- **Customizable**: Adjust scraping intervals, sources, and topics to suit your interests and preferences.
- **Zero Intervention**: No fine tuning or maintainence would be required once configured.
